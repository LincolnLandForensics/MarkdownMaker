## **Evidence Processing:**

☐ Sanitize exhibits as needed (stickers stick better without grease)

☐ Input exhibit details into [S:\Cases\ForensicCases.xlsx](file://S:/Cases/ForensicCases.xlsx)

☐ Print stickers x 4 (python ForensicsReporter.py -s)

☐ Tape stickers on all removable items (HDD, PC, Side Panel, Power supply, etc)

☐ Shelve and update StorageLocation in sheet (ex. 4th Floor Lab A6)

☐ Setup a case folder setup on your Fred

☐ E:\Cases\<CaseNumber>_<Business>\ (EVERYTHING in this folder gets backed up to B:\

☐ Image HDD (name the image <CaseNumber>_Ex(Exhibit#)_<CaseName>.e01) Save in (Image folder)

☐ Import imaging log into ForensicCases.xlsx (python ForensicsReporter.py -l )

☐ Write a summary of the warrant in the first exhibit number Summary column. (Ex. On <date>, <examiner> attended the warrant at the <address>, <town>, Illinois.)

☐ Copy all case exhibit lines into Printing_Temp sheet in [S:\Cases\ForensicCases.xlsx](file://S:/Cases/ForensicCases.xlsx), print and tape onto the top of the shelf. Draw arrows for multi-shelf cases.

☐ c:\pagefile and c:\hiberfil with passware kit and volatility

☐ Extract passwords out of c:\hyberfil.sys or pagefile.sys

Open passware <Memory analysis> (good luck)

☐ memprocFS_process.py forensics 1 c:\temp\memdump.raw

☐ prefetch to win prefetch viewer

☐ C:\Windows\System32\config/SAM & SYSTEM - crack username/passwords (optional)

☐ Browser passwords to passwords.xlsx

☐ Registry Explorer (bookmarks)
